# HackerNews-SQLite-Project

Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. Itâ€™s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

title: the title of the story
user: the user who submitted the story
score: the score of the story
timestamp: the time of the story
url: the link of the story

This analysis provided valuable insights into trends and user behavior on Hacker News. Here's a summary of the key findings:

Popular Stories: The analysis identified the top five stories based on their scores, providing a glimpse into the topics that resonated most with users.
Power Users: A small percentage of users contributed a significant portion of the total score, suggesting a potential echo chamber effect.
Rickrolling: The analysis identified users who repeatedly posted a link to a prank video, highlighting the need for potential moderation.
Source Distribution: The analysis categorized stories by their source website (e.g., GitHub, Medium), revealing which sites fed the most content to Hacker News.
Posting Time: The analysis explored the correlation between posting time and a story's score, suggesting that mornings and evenings might be better times to submit content.
These findings offer valuable guidance for anyone interested in understanding Hacker News' dynamics, from content creators to casual users. By leveraging this information, users can tailor their content and engagement strategies to maximize their reach and impact on the platform.
